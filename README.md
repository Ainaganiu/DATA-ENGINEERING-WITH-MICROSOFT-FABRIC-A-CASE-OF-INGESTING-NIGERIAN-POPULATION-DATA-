# DATA-ENGINEERING-WITH-MICROSOFT-FABRIC-A-CASE-OF-INGESTING-NIGERIAN-POPULATION-DATA-
The main aim of the project is to build an ETL pipeline for Nigeria Population data using Microsoft Fabric using Architecture such as LakeHouse, Notebook, Semantic Model and Power BI for data visualization.

# Introduction
In many cases, companies require information from trustworthy sources outside their own databases. This data is important for tasks like studying the market and connecting analytical insights to the outside world, such as conducting a SWOT Analysis.

# Objective of the Project
The aim of the project is to create a system that can collect, organize, and update information from the Worldometer website. This makes the data easily accessible for everyone in the organization to use whenever they require it using Microsoft Fabric Architecture.
## Project Architecture
Microsoft Fabric is a collection of tools designed for individuals working with data, covering tasks in data engineering, analytics, and machine learning. It accommodates various preferred tools like Python, R, SQL, and DAX, as well as user-friendly options like DataFlow (Power Query). This entire framework is constructed on the Microsoft Azure platform.
In our project, we utilized a Workspace, which acts as a designated folder within Fabric to organize all our projects and resources. We also incorporated other components of the Microsoft Fabric Architecture, including Notebooks, Semantic Models, and Power BI. Each of these elements plays a specific role in managing and presenting our data effectively.
